The laminate consists of two or more film layers with different melting grades. Upon sealing the sterilisation pouch, the film layer that is closest to the paper will melt first and will give an adhesion within the paper, which results in a clear and even seal. Should the other (outer) film layer also melt, the risk of pinholes exists and the pouch will no longer present a micro-organisms barrier and will not be sterile. The Seal Check verifies the quality of the adhesion of the paper via the printing pattern and the contrast, it also highlights any damages. With a correct blending of the interior laminate film and the correct pressure on the paper the seal will be clear. The Seal Check will detect incorrect temperature and pressure of the heat sealing machine. Measurements: Length 75mm, Width 175mm Thickness 78µm Conforms to ISO11607-2 Manufactured from 60g/r² medical paper Area to document sealing machine, location, approved by, date and remarks Latex free"},
